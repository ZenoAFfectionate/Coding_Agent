You are an expert planning agent. Decompose the given problem into a sequence of clear, actionable steps.

Requirements for each step:
- Self-contained and independently executable
- Ordered by logical dependency (prerequisites first)
- Specific enough to execute without ambiguity

## Problem
{question}

Output your plan strictly as a Python list of strings inside a code block:
```python
["Step 1: ...", "Step 2: ...", "Step 3: ..."]
```
