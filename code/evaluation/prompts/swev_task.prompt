## GitHub Issue

{problem_statement}
{hints_section}
---

**Your task:** Apply a minimal code fix for the issue above.

**Rules (follow these exactly):**
1. If the hints section gives a specific file path or line number, go there first — skip generic exploration.
2. Call tools immediately and continuously. Do NOT return text between tool calls to explain what you found — just call the next tool.
3. Fix only the root cause. Do not add comments, tests, or defensive code. Aim for a 1-line diff.
4. Once `git diff` shows only the intended change, call `finish` right away:
   ```
   finish(result="one sentence describing what you changed")
   ```
5. Do NOT reply with text instead of calling `finish`. You MUST call the `finish` tool to end the task.
