## Task: Write a Triton GPU Kernel

{instruction}

## Required API (your code MUST export these exact names and signatures)

{api_spec}

## Rules (follow these exactly)
1. Write complete, runnable Triton code including all imports (torch, triton, triton.language as tl).
2. You MUST use the exact function names, class names, parameter names, and module-level aliases listed above. The test harness calls these names directly — any mismatch will cause a NameError or TypeError.
3. Save the code as `solution.py` using the file tool.
4. Do NOT include any test code or main blocks.
5. Call tools immediately and continuously. Do NOT return text between tool calls.
6. Once the code is written and passes the linter, call `finish` right away.
7. Do NOT reply with text instead of calling `finish`. You MUST call the `finish` tool to end the task.
