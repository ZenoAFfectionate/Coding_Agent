## Requirements
- Write a **complete** Python program that reads from **stdin** and writes to **stdout**.
- Save it as `solution.py` using the file tool.

## Testing
- The `code_exec` python mode has **no stdin**. To test, use shell mode with a pipe:
  ```
  code_exec("shell", "echo 'sample_input' | python3 solution.py")
  ```
- Verify output against the sample(s) **exactly** — watch for trailing spaces, newlines, and numeric formatting.
- If multiple test samples are given, test all of them.

## Output Format
- Print **only** the required answer — no labels, prompts, or debug output.
- Match the sample output format precisely (integer vs float, separator, line breaks).
